# Storage Secrets

To get a secrets file from Google, you typically need to follow these steps:

* Create a Project in Google Cloud Console: Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and create a new project if you haven't already.

* Navigate to the API & Services Credentials: Once you have your project set up, navigate to the API & Services section. You can find this in the left-hand menu.

* Create Credentials: Click on "Credentials" and then select "Create Credentials" from the dropdown menu. Choose the type of credentials you need. For secrets file, you might select "Service account key".

* Choose the Service Account: If you're creating a service account key, select the service account you want to create a key for, or create a new one if necessary.

* Choose the Key Type and Download: Select the key type JSON, and then click "Create". This will download the key file to your computer. This file contains the credentials you need to access Google services programmatically.

* Store the Key Securely: Ensure you keep the downloaded key file in a secure location. Do not expose it publicly, as it contains sensitive information.

* Use the Key in Your Application: You can then use this key file in your application to authenticate and authorize access to Google services as needed.

* Remember to adhere to Google's best practices for handling and securing credentials to prevent unauthorized access to your resources.

This is what the key file will look like. 

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "your-project-id",
  "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourPrivateKeyHere\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "your-service-account-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account-email%40your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}
```
Please note that you'll need to replace the placeholders (your-project-id, your-private-key-id, YourPrivateKeyHere, your-service-account-email, and your-client-id) with the actual values from your service account key file.
